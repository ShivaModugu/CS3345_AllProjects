This repository encapsulates a comprehensive array of projects accomplished during the Fall 2023 Semester as part of CS3345 - Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms. Explore the intricacies of each project, gaining insights into the implementation, analysis, and optimization of advanced data structures and algorithms. Your exploration is welcomed, and any feedback or contributions are highly encouraged for the continual enhancement of this collaborative learning endeavor.


<strong>Project 1:</strong> 
This project involves the implementation of a memory management simulation using a linked list in Java. The main objective is to create a class named MemLinkedList that operates on nodes representing free or allocated memory blocks, along with their respective sizes. The implemented methods include allocating memory, releasing memory with merging capabilities, resetting the list to its initial state, and providing a demonstration of these functionalities in the main method. The submission requires the file MemLinkedList.java to be uploaded to the eLearning platform by the specified deadline.
